OpenQuake engine is the seismic hazard and risk calculation software developed by the GEM 
Foundation. By following current standards in software developments like test-driven development 
and continuous integration, the OpenQuake engine aims at becoming an open, and community-driven 
tool for seismic hazard and risk analysis.

The source code of the OpenQuake engine is available on a public web-based repository at the 
following address: gem/oq-engine.

General overview
