Risk Inputs
===========

The following sections describe the basic inputs required for a risk calculation, including exposure models, fragility 
models, consequence models, and vulnerability models. In addition, each risk calculator also requires the appropriate 
hazard inputs computed in the region of interest. Hazard inputs include hazard curves for the classical probabilistic 
damage and risk calculators, Ground Motion Field for the scenario damage and risk calculators, or Stochastic Event Sets 
for the probabilistic event based calculators.
