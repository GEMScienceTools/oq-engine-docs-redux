Correlation of Ground Motion Fields
-----------------------------------

There are multiple different kind of correlation on the engine, so it is 
extremely easy to get confused. Here I will list all possibilities, in historical 
order.

1. Spatial correlation of ground motion fields has been a feature of the engine from day one. The available models are JB2009 and HM2018.
2. Cross correlation in ShakeMaps has been available for a few years. The model used there is hard-coded an the user cannot change it, only disable it. The models list below (3. and 4.) have no effect on ShakeMaps.
3. Since version 3.13 the engine provides the BakerJayaram2008 cross correlation model, however at the moment it is used only in the conditional spectrum calculator.
4. Since version 3.13 the engine provides the GodaAtkinson2009 cross correlation model and the FullCrossCorrelation model which can be used in scenario and event based calculations.

Earthquake theory tells us that ground motion fields depend on two different 
lognormal distributions with parameters (:math:`\mu,\tau`) and (:math:`\mu,\phi`) 
respectively, which are determined by the GMPE (Ground Motion Prediction Equal). 
Given a rupture, a set of M intensity measure types and a collection of N sites, 
the parameters :math:`\mu,\tau` and :math:`\phi` are arrays of shape :math:`M, N`. 
:math:`\mu` is the mean of the logarithms and :math:`\tau` the between-event 
standard deviation, associated to the cross correlation, while :math:`\phi` is the 
within-event standard deviation, associated to the spatial correlation. :math:`\tau` and 
:math:`\phi` are normally N-independent, i.e. each array of shape :math:`M, N` 
actually contains N copies of the same M values read from the coefficient table 
of the GMPE.

In the OpenQuake engine each rupture has associated a random seed generated from 
the parameter ``ses_seed`` given in the job.ini file, therefore given a fixed 
number E of events it is possible to generate a deterministic distribution of 
ground motion fields, i.e. an array of shape (M, N, E). Technically such feature 
is implemented in the class ``openquake.hazardlib.calc.gmf.GmfComputer``. The 
algorithm used there is to generate two arrays of normally distributed numbers 
called :math:`\epsilon_\tau` (of shape (M, E)) and :math:`\epsilon_\phi`
(of shape (M, N, E)), one using the between-event standard deviation :math:`\tau`
and the other using the within-event standard deviation :math:`\phi`, while 
keeping the same mean :math:`\mu`. Then the ground motion fields are generated 
as an array of shape (M, N, E) with the formula

.. math::

 gmf\ =\ exp(\mu\ +crosscorel(\epsilon_\tau)\ + spatialcorrel(\epsilon_\phi))

The details depend on the form of the cross correlation model and of the spatial 
correlation model and you have to study the source code if you really want to 
understand how it works, in particular how the correlation matrices are extracted 
from the correlation models. By default, if no cross correlation nor spatial 
correlation are specified, then there are no correlation matrices and :math:`crosscorrel(\epsilon_\tau`)
and :math:`spatialcorrel(\epsilon_\phi)` are computed by using ``scipy.stats.truncnorm``. 
Otherwise ``scipy.stats.multivariate_normal`` with a correlation matrix of shape 
(M, M) is used for cross correlation and ``scipy.stats.multivariate_normal`` 
distribution with a matrix of shape (N, N) is used for spatial correlation. 
Notice that the truncation feature is lost if you use correlation, since scipy 
does not offer at truncated multivariate_normal distribution. Not truncating the 
normal distribution can easily generated non-physical fields, but even if the 
truncation is on it is very possible to generate exceedingly large ground motion 
fields, so the user has to be *very* careful.

Correlation is important because its presence normally causes the risk to 
increase, i.e. ignoring the correlation will under-estimate the risk. The best 
way to play with the correlation is to consider a scenario_risk calculation with 
a single rupture and to change the cross and spatial correlation models. 
Possibilities are to specify in the job.ini all possible combinations of::

	cross_correlation = FullCrossCorrelation 
	cross_correlation = GodaAtkinson2009 
	ground_motion_correlation_model = JB2009 
	ground_motion_correlation_model = HM2018

including removing one or the other or all correlations.
