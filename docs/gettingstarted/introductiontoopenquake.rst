Introduction to OpenQuake Engine
================================

Overview
--------

OpenQuake engine is the seismic hazard and risk calculation software developed by the GEM 
Foundation. By following current standards in software developments like test-driven development 
and continuous integration, the OpenQuake engine aims at becoming an open, and community-driven 
tool for seismic hazard and risk analysis.

The source code of the OpenQuake engine is available on a public web-based repository at the 
following address: gem/oq-engine.

The OpenQuake engine is available for the Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. It can be 
installed in several different ways. The :ref:`following page <installing-the-openquake-engine>` 
provides a handy guide for users to choose the most appropriate installation method 
depending on their intended use cases:

This user manual is for the command line interface for the OpenQuake engine.
