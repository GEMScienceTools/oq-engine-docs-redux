branch
------

The simplest element in a logic tree; it belongs to a branch set
where it represents one possible option among a finite number of
alternatives. A branch is associated with a weight value (Scherbaum
and Kuehn, 2011) if the branch set represents the
epistemic uncertainty on a parameter or a model when the branch set
is used to specify alternative models (e.g. district
Magnitude-Frequency Distributions(MFDs)).

branch set
----------

The structure describing the epistemic uncertainty on a specific
parameter or model included in a logic tree structure. It ensembles a
number of branches, each one representing a discrete alternative.

seismic source data
-------------------

An object containing the information necessary to completely describe
a PSHA seismic source i.e. seismic source type, position, geometry
and seismicity occurrence model.

seismic source model
--------------------

An object containing a list of seismic source data.
